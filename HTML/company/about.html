    <!-- A relative URL specifies the location of a resource relative to the current document's location. It doesn't 
        include the full domain or protocol information. Instead, it relies on the context of the current document to
         determine the base location from which the resource should be retrieved. Relative URLs are often used when 
         linking to resources within the same website or directory structure. -->

    <!-- An absolute URL provides the complete address or path to a resource on the web. It includes all the necessary 
        information to locate the resource, such as the protocol (e.g., http:// or https://), domain name 
        (e.g., www.example.com), port number (if applicable), and the full path to the resource. Absolute URLs 
        are typically used when linking to resources on external websites or when you want to provide a complete 
        and unambiguous reference to a resource. -->
